     *    Let's think about automation execution
     *       We have 3 Actors
     *       --The ENGINEER: That writes the automation code. Automation code sends requests to the webdriver.
     *       Ex: driver.get("http://google.com");
     *       --The WEBDRIVER: Executes the test engineer requests. It sends its own request to the browser.
     *       Ex: Get google.com
     *       --The BROWSER: It executes the webdrivers requests
     *       Ex: Open google.com
